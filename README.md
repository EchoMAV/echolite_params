# Onboard parameters for EchoLite
## Stack: ArduPilot

## Vehicle:
Multi-Rotor

## Version:
4.5.7 (echolite branch  https://github.com/EchoMAV/ardupilot/tree/echolite)

## Note:
several of these params are drone-specific and/or readonly. However, this is the full output from mavlink and as such can be inputted into the same or different drone without issue. Then once the drone reboots, ardupilot will update unique params.
